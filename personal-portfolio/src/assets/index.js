  },
  {
    question: "How much do you charge for a website?",

      "My website packages usually range from ₹2500 - ₹4500. However, it really depends on the kind of website you need. We recently wrote a full guide on website costs to give you an idea of the different options available.",

      https://tailwindgymproject.netlify.app

    question: "Why are you so expensive?",
    answer:
      "The process I use to build your website takes time and involves extensive planning and research. Unlike other Developers, I don’t use templates; I build your website from scratch, giving you a unique design tailored around your business. Your website is a sales tool that should earn you money, not just a business expense.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
    answer:
      "It takes approximately 6-10 weeks to build a website from start to finish, provided we have all the necessary information from you. Generally, delays happen if we’re still waiting on text and images from you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we communicate throughout the website build?",
    answer:
      "Before starting, we’ll typically have an initial chat via phone or Google Meet to discuss the project. During the process, most communication will happen over email, making it easier to save and reference information. Once finished, I will book your 1-hour digital marketing training session.",
  },
  {
    question: "What will you need from me?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the type of website you want. We’ll discuss this on our discovery call before starting. Based on the package we agree on, we may need specific content or resources.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don’t like the website?",
    answer:
      "I offers you a risk-free guarantee. Before building, I design a homepage mockup in Photoshop. Within about ten days, you’ll see the initial designs and can provide feedback. If you’re unsatisfied, you’re not obligated to continue, at no cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer a payment schedule?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I split the payment in two: 50% once you’re happy with the homepage mockup, and the remaining 50% 30 days later through PhonePay or any Digital Platforms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make the final payment when the site is ready to go live?",
    answer:
      "No. In the past, project delays often happened due to waiting for client-provided information, sometimes extending for months. To avoid delays, I invoice 30 days after the initial payment so you can see the progress as I work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who hosts the website?",
    answer:
      "I only generally manage hosting for clients, using a reliable company we’ve partnered with for years. Each website is managed individually for security, with features like unlimited bandwidth, 20GB disk space, 2GB RAM, and 99.9% uptime.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update the website myself once it’s built?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I will provide training and tools for updating the website independently. We use WordPress, an easy-to-use platform where you can add, edit, and delete content without additional costs.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I don’t want to manage the website at all? Can you do it for me?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I offer maintenance packages tailored to your needs, ranging from 1 to 10 hours per month. We will discuss the right package for you via PhoneCall.",
