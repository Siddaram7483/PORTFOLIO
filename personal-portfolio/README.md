# Personal Portfolio
Hello There,

This is a personal portfolio web application built with **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It showcases the skills and projects of Siddaram Mahadev Kusur. The website is designed to be responsive and visually engaging, providing a smooth experience with animations and interactive elements.

## Features

- **React & Next.js**: Used for building the user interface and server-side rendering to improve performance and SEO.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions throughout the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easier to design responsive layouts and create a visually appealing UI.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is somewhat responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and in some of the limited mobiles).
- **Local Storage**: Integrated local storage for saving and retrieving user preferences (if required).
-**DARK-THEME/WHITE-THEME**: added dark theme which is basically works like if you are first time user and if you press on dark mode and then when u come back to see this website u will set to dark theme not white theme because as you already prefered dark theme and whenevr you visits it will show dark theme only.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing layouts quickly and efficiently.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React to create animations and transitions with ease.
- **ReactJS LocalStorage**: Simple way to interact with the browser’s localStorage API.
- **Remix Icon**: Set of customizable icons for adding icons to the portfolio.

## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

//Vercel for NextJS
Deployment on Vercel:
Step-by-Step Process:
Push Your Code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:
First, ensure your Next.js project is pushed to a Git repository.

Sign up or Log in to Vercel:
Visit Vercel and create an account (or log in if you already have one).

Link Your Repository:

On the Vercel dashboard, click New Project.
Select GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket, depending on where your code is hosted).
Choose your Next.js repository.
Configure Build Settings (Vercel detects Next.js automatically):

Framework: Select Next.js from the dropdown (if not detected automatically).
Build Command: npm run build (automatically set by Vercel).
Output Directory: Vercel automatically sets this to .next/ which is fine for Next.js.
Deploy Your Site:
Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site as soon as you link the repository. Once it’s done, Vercel will provide a live URL for your project.
